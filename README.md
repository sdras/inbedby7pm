My first VS Code Theme was [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme), and I got a request for a new kind of theme for other folks: [In Bed By 7pm](https://twitter.com/toddmorey/status/1309982499003564034?s=20).

About this theme, and some of the considerations made while creating it (as well as _how_ to create it should you want to make your own): [https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/)
